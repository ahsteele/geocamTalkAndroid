About
~~~~~

The GeoCam Project helps people better understand and respond to disasters.
GeoCam consists of a GPS-enabled camera (or cell phone) and a web app for
sharing geotagged photos and other geospatial data.

GeoCam Memo For Android is the android component of a scribing and 
note-taking application intended for use by search team members as they 
canvas the scene of a disaster. Notes can be recorded using text or audio 
and various forms of attachments (including but not limited to images) can 
be attached for transmission to a central server. All messages can be 
geotagged and categorized before saving to provide proper context when 
analyzing them via a web interface at a later time.
