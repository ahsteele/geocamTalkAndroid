About
~~~~~

The GeoCam Project helps people better understand and respond to disasters.
GeoCam consists of a GPS-enabled camera (or cell phone) and a web app for
sharing geotagged photos and other geospatial data.

GeoCam Talk For Android is the android component of a communication application 
intended to aid in communication during a search mission. Members can send text 
and audio messages to any subset of their team members while on the field from 
their mobile devices. All messages are sent through a central server which 
catalogs them for later analysis. Just as in Memo, all messages are geotagged 
to provide instant awareness of team member location.
